    "This has just touched the surface of possibilities for numerical optimisation. As you can see, even the basic scipy installation provides some powerful algorithms: they may require a little tuning to get the results you need, but are in general quite robust and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the routines here are designed simply to perform one function: minimize an objective function.\n",
    "Therefore, as long as you can specify an objective function appropriately, these algorithms may be useful (even if the actual computation of the objective function becomes more complicated).\n",
    "For example fitting an ODE model to some time series would basically require that you specify your objective function as the difference between an experimental time series and your model under a certain parametrisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For working on more complex systems, or in cases where you have complicated or noisy data, other packages may present a more viable alternative. \n",
    "In reality, especially when dealing with noisy experimental data, it is crucial to choose the right optimisation routine for job. \n",
    "In many cases it may be beneficial to use a probabilistic method, for example, and often you will end up using **global optimizers**, which we didn't have time to go into today.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, some that I like to use are:\n",
    "- [PySwarm](http://pythonhosted.org/pyswarm/): a simple constrained particle swarm optimisation tool\n",
    "- [PyGMO](http://esa.github.io/pygmo/): a very powerful serial and parallel toolbox for constructing global optimisation routines\n",
    "- [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap): another global optimisation package, strongly focused on large scale parallel evolutionary algorithms."
